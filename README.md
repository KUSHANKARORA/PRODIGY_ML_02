**K-Means Clustering on Purchase Data**
Welcome to the repository for the second task of the internship at Prodigy Infotech! This task involves implementing K-means clustering on purchase data to segment customers based on their buying behavior.

***Task Description***
In this task, we aim to cluster customers into distinct groups based on similarities in their purchase patterns. K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique that partitions data into K clusters where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
